# SQLNameChecker
A java project that lets the user enters names. Uses a mySQL database.

A personal project that I did on my own time. This project has 3 functions.
First, you can view the contents of the names table
Second, you can insert a name of a person you have interacted with
Lastly, you can check to see if a name is in the database

For all three of the above, the project also prints out the date of the last time you have interacted with them. For the second function, it's the date you've entered the name.

This project does require additional setup than just an IDE, this guide should give you an almost guarenteed setup:

Make sure the user/password/port matches up to what it is in my ConnectionMySql class.
